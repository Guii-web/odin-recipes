        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Delicious cookies that have the same basic flavor as peanut butter cookies, but can be eaten by people with peanut and milk allergies! 
            I love to make these with my friend because she has a peanut allergy and I have a dairy allergy. 
            They taste great and no one can tell that they are dairy free!</p>
