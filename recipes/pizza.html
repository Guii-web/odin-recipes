          <li>1 tablespoon of sugar</li> 
          <li>1 ½ teaspoons of salt</li>
          <li>1 ⅓ cups of very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li> 
          <li>⅓ cup of oil</li> 
        </ul>
        <h4>Toppings:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) package of HORMEL® Pepperoni</li>
            <li>1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; 
                set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste.</li>
            <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. 
                Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). 
                Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
            <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. 
                Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
            <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. 
                For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
        </ol>
